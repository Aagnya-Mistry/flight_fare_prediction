# Flight Fare Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts flight fares based on various factors, such as airline, flight details, departure/arrival times, and more. The model is built using Python and Flask, with a RandomForestRegressor for accurate fare prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language for developing the model and backend.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for deploying the model as a web application.
- **RandomForestRegressor**: A machine learning algorithm used to predict the flight fare based on the dataset.

## Model Details
The model uses historical flight data, including features such as:
- Airline
- Flight number
- Departure and arrival times
- Source and destination cities
- Flight duration
- Number of stops
- Ticket class
- Price

The RandomForestRegressor is trained on this data and used to predict the price of a flight based on input features provided by the user.
